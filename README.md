#QR code generator
Welcome to QR Code Generator, an application that allows you to easily create QR codes for any data or link.

This application is built using JavaScript and includes several key features, such as:
* QR code generation using user-provided data or link
* Input validation to ensure that the data or link is not empty

To use this application, simply enter the data or link that you want to convert into a QR code and press the "Generate" button. If the input is empty, an error message will be displayed, and the QR code will not be generated. Once the input is valid, the QR code will be displayed on the screen, which can be saved as an image or shared.

This application uses JavaScript and HTML/CSS to build the application.

You can access the deployed version of the application at https://qr-code-web-app.onrender.com

Thanks for using QR Code Generator!
